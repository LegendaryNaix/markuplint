			"name": "download",
			"description": "This attribute instructs browsers to download a URL instead of navigating to it, so the user will be prompted to save it as a local file. If the attribute has a value, it is used as the pre-filled file name in the Save prompt (the user can still change the file name if they want). There are no restrictions on allowed values, though / and \\ are converted to underscores. Most file systems limit some punctuation in file names, and browsers will adjust the suggested name accordingly.\n Notes:\n \n  This attribute only works for same-origin URLs.\n  This attribute can be used with blob: URLs and data: URLs to download content generated by JavaScript, such as pictures created in an image-editor Web app.\n  If the HTTP header Content-Disposition: gives a different filename than this attribute, the HTTP header takes priority over this attribute.\n  If Content-Disposition: is set to inline, Firefox prioritizes Content-Disposition, like the filename case, while Chrome prioritizes the download attribute.\n \n \n "

			"description": "Indicates which referrer to send when fetching the URL:\n \n  'no-referrer' means the Referer: header will not be sent.\n  'no-referrer-when-downgrade' means no Referer: header will be sent when navigating to an origin without HTTPS. This is the default behavior.\n  'origin' means the referrer will be the origin of the page, not including information after the domain.\n  'origin-when-cross-origin' meaning that navigations to other origins will be limited to the scheme, the host and the port, while navigations on the same origin will include the referrer's path.\n  'unsafe-url' means the referrer will include the origin and path, but not the fragment, password, or username. This is unsafe because it can leak data from secure URLs to insecure ones.\n \n "

The following keywords have special meanings:\n \n  _self: Load the URL into the same browsing context as the current one. This is the default behavior.\n  _blank: Load the URL into a new browsing context. This is usually a tab, but users can configure browsers to use new windows instead.\n  _parent: Load the URL into the parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent, this behaves the same way as _self.\n  _top: Load the URL into the top-level browsing context (that is, the \"highest\" browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent). If there is no parent, this behaves the same way as _self.\n \n\n \n Note: When using target, consider adding rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" to avoid exploitation of the window.opener API.\n \n "
