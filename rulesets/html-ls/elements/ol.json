The interpretation of this attribute depends on the user agent and it doesn't work in all browsers. Note: Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated: the <ol> element should be styled using CSS. To give an effect similar to the compact attribute, the CSS property line-height can be used with a value of 80%."

Unless the value of the list number matters (e.g. in legal or technical documents where items are to be referenced by their number/letter), the CSS list-style-type property should be used instead.\n "
