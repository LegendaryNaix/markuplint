This value is the default if the attribute is not specified.\n  _blank: Load the result into a new unnamed browsing context.\n  _parent: Load the result into the parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self.\n  _top: Load the result into the top-level browsing context (that is, the browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent). If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self.\n \n "
