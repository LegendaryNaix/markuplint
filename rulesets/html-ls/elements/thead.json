Possible values are:\n \n  left, aligning the content to the left of the cell\n  center, centering the content in the cell\n  right, aligning the content to the right of the cell\n  justify, inserting spaces into the textual content so that the content is justified in the cell\n  char, aligning the textual content on a special character with a minimal offset, defined by the char and charoff attributes Unimplemented (see bug 2212).\n \n\n If this attribute is not set,  the left value is assumed.\n\n Note: Do not use this attribute as it is obsolete (not supported) in the latest standard.\n\n \n  To achieve the same effect as the left, center, right or justify values, use the CSS text-align property on it.\n  To achieve the same effect as the char value, in CSS3, you can use the value of the char as the value of the text-align property Unimplemented.\n \n \n "
