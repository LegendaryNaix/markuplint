			"description": "This enumerated attribute specifies how horizontal alignment of each column cell content will be handled. Possible values are:\n \n  left, aligning the content to the left of the cell\n  center, centering the content in the cell\n  right, aligning the content to the right of the cell\n  justify, inserting spaces into the textual content so that the content is justified in the cell\n  char, aligning the textual content on a special character with a minimal offset, defined by the char and charoff attributes Unimplemented (see bugÂ 2212).\n \n\n If this attribute is not set, its value is inherited from the align of the <colgroup> element this <col> element belongs too. If there are none, the left value is assumed.\n\n Note: Do not use this attribute as it is obsolete (not supported) in the latest standard.\n\n \n  To achieve the same effect as the left, center, right or justify values:\n\n   \n    Do not try to set the text-align property on a selector giving a <col> element. Because <td> elements are not descendant of the <col> element, they won't inherit it.\n    If the table doesn't use a colspan attribute, use the td:nth-child(an+b) CSS selector. Set a to zero and b to the position of the column in the table, e.g. td:nth-child(2) { text-align: right; } to right-align the second column.\n    If the table does use a colspan attribute, the effect can be achieved by combining adequate CSS attribute selectors like [colspan=n], though this is not trivial.\n   \n  \n  To achieve the same effect as the char value, in CSS3, you can use the value of the char as the value of the text-align property Unimplemented.\n \n \n "
